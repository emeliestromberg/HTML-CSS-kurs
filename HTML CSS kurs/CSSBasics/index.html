    <h1>Welcome to CSS Basics</h1>

    <p>Hello everybody. This is Shakespear. <em>Enjoy</em></p>

    <div>
    <p>Juliet: O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
        Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
        Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
        And I'll no longer be a Capulet.

        <br><br>
        
        Romeo: [Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?

        <br><br>
        
        Juliet: 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
        Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
        What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
        Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
        Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
        What's in a name? that which we call a rose
        By any other name would smell as sweet;
        So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
        Retain that dear perfection which he owes
        Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
        And for that name which is no part of thee
        Take all myself. </p>

        <br>

        <h2>Oh lookie here!</h2>
        <p>Romeo and Juliet is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A tradgedy</li>
            <li>A masterpiece</li>
            <li>Really cool</li>
        </ul>
